Changes in v1.2.1
1. stack: discard NaN traces before passing the data to each method.
2. robust: fixed a bug when outlier traces have huge amplitudes, which would cause the dot product 
  and L2 norms too large to be handeled by the system. The final stack will be scaled back.

========================
Changes in v1.2.0
1. Added tfpws_dost() as a faster tfpws method, implemented by Jared Bryan.
2. Added handles for only 1 trace.
3. Added DOST class in core module.
4. Added power2pad() to pad zeros for closest power of 2 length.

=========================
Changes in v1.1.1
1. robust: fixed a bug when a few traces have very small amplitudes (anomalously small),
  which will result in zeros in ri_norm.

===============================
Changes in v1.1.0

CORE
1. In robust() and selective(), added option to specify reference stack.
2. In selective() and clusterstack(), added option to specify window of interest [index_start,index_end]
3. Moved rms() from core.py to utils.py.

==============================
v1.0.3
1. Added MANIFEST.in file.
